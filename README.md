# ml_boilerplate

For the venv:

`python3.10 -m venv venv`

`source venv/bin/activate`

Check with: 

`python --version`


For this project, I will be taking the following courses from Kaggle:
- 0 - Intro to ML course
- 1 - Intermediate ML
- 2 - Data Visualisation
- 3 - Feature Engineering
- 4 - Intro to Deep Learning
- 5 - Computer vision
- 6 - Time Series
- 7 - Data Cleaning
- 8 - Machine Learning Explainability
- 9 - Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning
- 10 - Gen AI Guide
- 11 - NLP Guide

I will then try to construct a boilerplate for most ML projects.
